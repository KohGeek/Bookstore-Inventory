# Bookstore Inventory

Assignment as required by Programming & Problem Solving Course

## Prerequisites

- MSVC 2019, or any C++17 supporting compilers
  - MFC and ATL libraries may be needed
- [Nana GUI](https://github.com/cnjinhao/nana)
- [csv](https://github.com/p-ranav/csv)

### More information

The included `.bat` files links the Nana GUI library as `lib/nana.lib`, and also includes a `include` subfolder for all the header files.

## Description

The assignment required the making of C++ program with the following functions:

- Adding a book record
- Deleting a book record
- Editing a book record
- List information
- Searching for book records
- Exiting a program

Naturally, when the issue of a database environment comes up, one would be interested in either DBMS or formatted data type at the very least. ~~However, the lecturer has directly specified that CSV/plain text be used. Further confirmation are to be carried out to make sure that external libraries can be used.~~ Lecturer has confirmed and allowed for the usage of third party library and non-CSV file, though for simulating client-programmer interaction, CSV requirement will be fulfilled.
