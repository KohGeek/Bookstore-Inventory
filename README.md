# Bookstore Inventory

Assignment as required by Programming & Problem Solving Course

## Prerequisites

- MSVC 2019, or any C++17 supporting compilers
  - MFC and ATL libraries may be needed
- [tabulate](https://github.com/p-ranav/tabulate)
- [csv](https://github.com/p-ranav/csv)

## Description

The assignment required the making of C++ program with the following functions:

- Adding a book record
- Deleting a book record
- Editing a book record
- List information
- Searching for book records
- Exiting a program

Naturally, when the issue of a database environment comes up, one would be interested in either DBMS or formatted data type at the very least. ~~However, the lecturer has directly specified that CSV/plain text be used. Further confirmation are to be carried out to make sure that external libraries can be used.~~ Lecturer has confirmed and allowed for the usage of third party library and non-CSV file, though for simulating client-programmer interaction, CSV requirement will be fulfilled.

## Future Plans

As the assignment itself has came to a fateful end, perhaps a bit dramatic even for those involved, the repo has been made public for all to use and learn. Future plans of this project will be listed below, but knowing us it may very well be a pipe dream.

- [ ] Developing a fully GUI version
- [ ] Polishing and complete rid of validation bugs (we know it's there, but 3 hours of QA can't do much)
- [ ] Update the ext. libs to the latest version
