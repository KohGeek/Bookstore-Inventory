Naturally, when the issue of a database environment comes up, one would be interested in either DBMS or formatted data type at the very least. ~~However, the lecturer has directly specified that CSV/plain text be used. Further confirmation are to be carried out to make sure that external libraries can be used.~~ Lecturer has confirmed and allowed for the usage of third party library and non-CSV file, though for simulating client-programmer interaction, CSV requirement will be fulfilled.
